           <h1>WORKOUT FOR TYPE I Diabetes</h1>

    Exercise is an absolutely vital part of type 1 diabetes treatment. Staying fit and active throughout your life has many benefits, but the biggest one for people with diabetes is this: it helps you control diabetes and prevent long-term complications.
    Exercise makes it easier to control your blood glucose (blood sugar) level. Exercise benefits people with type 1 because it increases your insulin sensitivity. In other words, after exercise, your body doesn't need as much insulin to process carbohydrates.
    Additionally, there are all the traditional benefits of exercise:
•	Lower blood pressure
•	Better control of weight
•	Leaner, stronger muscles
•	Stronger bones
•	More energy
    Precautions
    Before you begin exercising, you need to set realistic goals. If you haven't exercised much recently, you aren't going to jump into running a marathon. In fact, you aren't even going to jump into running a 5k.
    Allow yourself some time to build up to a steady, challenging exercise routine. It is okay to slowly increase your physical activity—it's better for your body in the long run.
    Finally, talk to your doctor and/or Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) about adjusting your (or your child's) insulin around exercise. You don't want to become hypoglycemic during a work-out, so you'll need to do some planning.
    A Few Exercise Suggestions 
    There are three main kinds of exercise—aerobic, strength training, and flexibility work. You should aim to have a good balance of all three.
    Aerobic Exercises
    Aerobic exercises include:
•	Walking
•	Jogging/Running
•	Tennis
•	Basketball
•	Swimming
•	Biking
    You should aim to get at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise most days of the week. In fact, the American Diabetes Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic exercise a week, which works out to 30 minutes five days a week. If you think that you can't find 30 minutes, you can break up the exercise into chunks—10 minutes here and there.
    Also, stretch your creativity when it comes to fitting in exercise. Take a walk at lunch, or get the whole family out after dinner for a game of basketball.
